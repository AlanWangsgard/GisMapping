# Overview

I completed this project to learn something new.

This map show Denny's locations across the us. I compiled the data on my own. To use the map simple launch it and click on a point to see the denny's info.

I chose to write this project because I enjoy going to denn'y and it helped me to be more interested and have more fun with the project, while still learning.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
